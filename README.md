# Train time table data from <enter the web location>
## api key and api id are required from sign up.

This is My first use of git, with github and vscode.

This python app, uses Flask to generate the html code, and jinja to xxx
data from london train timetables is fetched once the user enters the train station they want
the idea is..... 
then they are told when the next 5 trains arrive.  
then they are told what train line this train is on.  they can then look up all the stations for this trainline.
